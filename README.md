This repository contains groups two repositories for texture synthesis:
* `syntex/`: `SynTex: Synthesize Textures Using Deep Neural Networks`
* `OptimalTexture`: `Optimal Textures: Fast and Robust Texture Synthesis and Style Transfer through Optimal Transport`

You will find in these subfolders documentation for using both methods and reproducing our results.
